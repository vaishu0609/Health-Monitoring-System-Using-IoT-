# Health-Monitoring-System-Using-IoT-
This project details an IoT-based health monitoring system designed to provide real-time tracking and analysis of vital health parameters. Leveraging IoT technology, the system collects data from various sensors connected to a microcontroller device. This data is then transmitted to a cloud platform  for storage, visualization, and analysis.
